Refer examples.cpp to explore more way to use.

## Customize

Many things are customize through macro function in logger.h file.

![alt text](https://github.com/shivangv6/Logger/blob/main/images/config.png?raw=true)

1. FILE LOG:- If required make true, otherwise false
2. CONSOLE LOG:- If required make true, otherwise false
3. Rollover:- File size (in MB) after which the new file generated with same name with +1 count number
4. Prefix of File name.
5. Log Levels
    - DISABLE_LOG = 1,
    - LOG_LEVEL_ERROR = 2,
    - LOG_LEVEL_TRACE = 3,
    - LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG = 4,
    - LOG_LEVEL_INFO = 5,
    - ENABLE_LOG = 6.
  
Currently I added only 4 levels (ERROR, TRACE, DEBUG, INFO) but other levels or severity can be added easily.
